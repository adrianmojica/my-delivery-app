In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

In a separate terminal tab run:
### `node server`

Launches the sockets server 

Refresh the http://localhost:3000
in your browser and watch the simulation run.

Thank you.
